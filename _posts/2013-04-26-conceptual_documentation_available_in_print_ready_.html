<p>Some of you expressed the wish of to be able to read the PostSharp documentation offline on their tablet or ebook reader, so we did it. Our conceptual documentation is now available as a <a href="http://www.postsharp.net/downloads/documentation/PostSharp-3.0.pdf" target="_blank">print-ready PDF document</a>, and looks awesome on screen and paper. </p>
<!-- readmore -->
 <p>It’s incredible the content renders to 140 pages, and it does not even include the class reference, which is still only available <a href="http://doc.postsharp.net/" target="_blank">online</a> or for download as a <a href="http://www.postsharp.net/downloads/documentation/PostSharp-3.0.chm" target="_blank">CHM</a>.</p> <p>But there’s an issue: although it looks like a book, it has been designed as a reference document and is not the best introduction to PostSharp. <a href="http://www.postsharp.net/support" target="_blank">Online tutorials</a> are still the preferred way to get started, and they are not included in the PDF.</p> <p>Happy PostSharping!</p> <p>-gael</p>
