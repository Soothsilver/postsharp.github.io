We live in a paradoxical world: all office applications support undo/redo, but very few business applications include this feature. Is this because
    undo/redo seems so difficult to implement? This is a problem we decided to address in <strong>PostSharp 4.0</strong> with the Recordable pattern.

        NOTE: This blog post is about an available pre-release of PostSharp. You can install PostSharp 4.0 only using NuGet by enabling the “Include
        pre-release” option. Undo/Redo is implemented in the package PostSharp.Patterns.Model.
    </em>
</p>
<h1>
    Recordable Pattern
</h1>
<p>
There are several approaches to the undo/redo problem. The design patterns literature recommends the    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_pattern">Memento pattern</a>, which basically relies on a snapshotting mechanism: you take a snapshot before
    an operation, and restore the object model to that snapshot if the operation needs to be undone. An alternative approach is to record changes to the object
    model and to undo/redo these changes. This is the approach we chose.
</p>
<p>
    The two principal parts of the Recordable pattern is the <em>[Recordable]</em> aspect, which injects into an class the ability to record changes, and the Recorder
    class, which stores these changes and expose the undo/redo semantics.
</p>
<p>
    Let’s show how this works on a simple example:
</p>
<pre>[Recordable]
class TableBooking
{
    public string CustomerName { get; set; }
    public DateTime StartTime { get; set; }
    public DateTime EndTime { get; set; }
    public int NumberOfPersons { get; set; }
    public string TableId { get; set; }

    public void Postpone(TimeSpan time)
    {
        this.StartTime += time;
        this.EndTime += time;
    }
}
</pre>
<p>
    The <em>[Recordable]</em> custom attribute causes changes in all <em>TableBooking</em> objects to be recorded. These objects can be bound directly to the UI using XAML
    bindings or can be modified using C#.
</p>
<p>
    By default, all changes are stored in a global recorder available from the <em>RecordingServices.DefaultRecorder </em>property. This property is provided for
    convenience; there are more options to assign different recorders if you need more flexibility. We’ll cover these advanced feature in later posts or in our
    final documentation.
</p>
<p>
    As you would expect, the <em>Recorder</em> class gives you the methods <em>Undo</em> and <em>Redo</em>:
</p>
<pre>booking.NumberOfPersons = 2;
booking.NumberOfPersons = 4;
RecordingServices.DefaultRecorder.Undo();
// At this point, booking.NumberOfPersons == 2;
RecordingServices.DefaultRecorder.Redo();
// At this point, booking.NumberOfPersons == 4;
</pre>

<h1>
    How it works
</h1>
<p>
    Under the cover, our implementation of the Recordable pattern records changes in all fields of the target class. When calling the Undo or Redo methods,
    fields are simply set to their previous value. This has the effect to restore the object to their previous state. Note that you can use the <em>[NotRecorded]</em>
    attribute to prevent a field or automatic property to be recorded.
</p>
<p>
    Taking this approach naively could cause some issues with atomicity. Consider the Postpone method in the code above. This method changes two properties in
    such a way that the total duration of the table booking is unaffected. Now suppose that the user hits the <em>Undo</em> button just after having postponed the
    booking. We don’t want the undo operation to affect just <em>EndTime</em> but not <em>StartTime</em>. The user would expect all operations performed by the <em>Postpone</em> method
    to be undone.
</p>
<p>
    PostSharp solves this problem by introducing the concept of recording scope. By default, all public methods of an object define an atomic scope. That is,
    all changes performed by the <em>Postpone</em> method are going to be undone atomically. This default behavior can be overridden by the <em>[RecordingScope]</em> attribute,
    which I will cover in a future article.
</p>
<h1>
    Explicit scopes
</h1>
<p>
    There are situations where you will want to programmatically control the recording scope. Suppose for instance that you bind the <em>NumberOfPersons</em> property
    to a slider control. While the user moves the slider, the value of the <em>NumberOfPersons</em> property is subsequently set to all values ranging from 1 to 10 and
    then back to 5, as the user releases the mouse button. While the user perceives this as a single operation, it actually results in 15 operations in the
    undo/redo list. This unpleasant experience can be improved by defining the recording scope programmatically, using the <em>OpenScope</em> method of the
<em>    Recorder</em> class.
</p>
<p>
    The following code snippet shows how to define a recording scope that matches a scope of source code.
</p>
<pre>using (RecordingServices.DefaultRecorder.OpenScope())
{
    booking.NumberOfPersons = 4;
    booking.NumberOfPersons = 5;
    booking.NumberOfPersons = 6;
    booking.NumberOfPersons = 7;
}

</pre>

<p>
    To open a scope when the user starts manipulating a <em>Slider</em> and close the scope when the user stops, we would need to call <em>OpenScope</em> from the
<em>    GotFocus</em> event and call Dispose from <em>LostFocus</em>.
</p>
<h1>
    Object Graphs and Collections
</h1>
<p>
    Up to now, we’ve only tracked changes to fields of an intrinsic type. But what if the fields are of more complex types, such as other objects and
    collections? The solution is simple: all classes that need to be involved in an undo/redo operation need to be made <em>[Recordable]</em>. Of course, we would not
    want to ask you to develop your own recordable collections. We don’t even want to have specific collection classes that implement the Recordable behavior.
</p>
<p>
    Do you remember our <a href="http://www.postsharp.net/blog/post/New-in-PostSharp-32-Aggregation-and-Composition-Patterns">Aggregatable pattern</a>? We
    faced the problem of providing collections that implement the parent-child relationship. Instead of providing specific classes, we develop collections to
    which the Aggregatable behavior can be dynamically injected. We’ve done exactly the same with Recordable. Our Recordable pattern relies on the Aggregatable
    patterns. All children collections will be automatically made recordable.
</p>

<pre>[Recordable]
public class Invoice
{
    [Child]
    public readonly AdvisableCollection&lt;InvoiceLine&gt; Lines = new AdvisableCollection&lt;InvoiceLine&gt;();

    [Child]
    public readonly AdvisableCollection&lt;InvoiceDiscount&gt; Discounts = new AdvisableCollection&lt;InvoiceDiscount&gt;();

    [Reference]
    public Customer Customer;
}

[Recordable]
public class InvoiceLine
{
    public decimal Quantity;

    [Reference]
    public Product Product;

    [Parent]
    public Invoice ParentInvoice { get; private set; }
}


[Recordable]
public class Customer
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
}

[Recordable]
public class InvoiceDiscount
{
    public decimal Percent;
    public string Reason;

    [Parent]
    public Invoice ParentInvoice { get; private set; }
}
</pre>


<h1>
    Other features
</h1>
<p>
    In this article, I just wanted to introduce the basic features of our Recordable pattern implementation. There are many more features I will describe in a
    later post:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            Multiple recorders: You can have several recorders in your application instead of the default single global one.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
Callback methods that make your objects aware of undo/redo operations.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p></li>
    
    <li>
        <p>
            Fully customizable operation naming so you can display the list of undoable operations to the user.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            History trimming.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h1>
    Summary
</h1>
<p>
    PostSharp 3.2 makes it much easier to implement the undo/redo in your Windows or Windows Phone application. You can try it yourself today by downloading
    the <em>PostSharp.Patterns.Model</em> pre-release package from NuGet and playing with the [Recordable] attribute and the Recorder class.
</p>
<p>
    What do you think? Would you have implemented your current project differently if this feature was available? How much code would you have saved?
</p>
<p>
    Happy PostSharping!
