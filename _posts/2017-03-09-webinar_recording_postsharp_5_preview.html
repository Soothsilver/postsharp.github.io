<p>In this webinar, PostSharp&rsquo;s founder and principal architect Gael Fraiteur demonstrates some of the most exciting new features of PostSharp 5.0:</p>
<!--readmore-->

<ul>
<li><strong>Logging:</strong> PostSharp 5.0 comes with a fully revamped logging aspect, which allows for much more flexibility than before. Key new features include complete customizability, support for semantic logging, and super-fast performance.</li>
<li><strong>Caching:</strong> You can now cache method return values and invalidate the cache easily, with custom attributes. PostSharp 5.0 will include support for MemoryCache and Redis, two-layered caches, and local caches with pub/sub invalidation.</li>
<li><strong>Async methods:</strong> We have filled the gaps in OnMethodBoundayAspect and MethodInterceptionAspect for async methods.</li>
</ul>
