<p>To add more transparency on how we work internally, we added two new pages to our public web site:</p><ul><li>The <a href="https://www.postsharp.net/support/roadmap">Product Roadmap</a> describes our current vision for the next months.</li><li>The <a href="https://www.postsharp.net/support/policies">Support and Quality Policies</a> page explains how we take decisions regarding bug fixes, release lifecycle, platform support and quality standards here at PostSharp.</li></ul><p>Donâ€™t hesitate to get in touch if you have any question.</p><p>Happy PostSharping!</p><p>-gael</p>
