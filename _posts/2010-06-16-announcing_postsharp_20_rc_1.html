<p>I am pleased to announce PostSharp 2.0 RC 1, available for <a href="http://www.sharpcrafters.com/downloads/postsharp-2.0/rc-1">download</a> today. This is a real release candidate: it could be promoted to RTW if community’s feedback is good. The last CTP proved very stable (only a couple of major bugs have been reported), so I am very confident with this RC.</p>  <p>People, now it’s seriously time to migrate from PostSharp 1.5 to 2.0. I’ll blog about it next week so you won’t have any excuse!</p>  <h2>What’s New in this RC?</h2>  <ul>   <li><a href="http://doc.sharpcrafters.com/postsharp/2.0">Documentation!</a></li>    <li>Fixed support for Code Analysis (FxCop)</li>    <li>Easier configuration using files <a href="http://doc.sharpcrafters.com/postsharp/2.0/Content.aspx/PostSharp.chm/html/541CB3E3-9C3B-4E6F-B52F-FA7DC01F6EF9.htm">PostSharp.Custom.targets</a>.</li>    <li>Streamlined license configuration and checking.</li>    <li>Happy Monday. Users of the community edition will figure out next Monday.</li>    <li>Add methods GetValue/SetValue to class LocationInfo</li>    <li>SDK: support for moving declarations from one parent to another </li> </ul>  <h2>Bug Fixes</h2>  <p>This release fixes the following issues:</p>  <ul>   <li>MethodInterceptionAspect: local variables not visible in the debugger&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </li>    <li>Native host: access to AssemblyReferenceList cache should be synchronized&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </li>    <li>Support for assembly key revocation&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </li>    <li>The MSBuild task should clean the license key before adding it to the command line&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </li>    <li>ImportMemberAdvice may import the wrong implementation if Order=AfterIntroductions&#160;&#160;&#160; </li>    <li>EventInterceptionAspect does not work for delegates returning a value&#160;&#160;&#160; </li>    <li>Possibility to move a declaration from one parent collection to another&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </li>    <li>AssertionFailedException in InstructionBlockBuilder&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </li>    <li>GUI feature allowing to disable the evaluation period expiration message&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </li>    <li>OnMethodBoundaryAspect throws InvalidOperationException&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </li>    <li>PathTooLongException thrown during license checking&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </li>    <li>Reference assemblies passed through file name (not directory) are not found&#160;&#160;&#160; </li>    <li>MethodExecutionArgs.Method is set to the generic method definition instead of the generic method instance&#160;&#160;&#160; </li>    <li>Optimization of OnMethodBoundaryAspect may cause unwanted sharing of MethodExecutionTag&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </li> </ul>  <h2>What’s Next?</h2>  <p>I consider my job is done with PostSharp 2.0. I’m confident I’ll publish the RTW in early July. I should be able to provide hot fixes very quickly (even next business day) during the next 30 days.</p>  <p>Now that the product is finished, it’ll be time to temporarily remove my programmer’s hat and focus on two essential activities: marketing and hiring. If you know a sharp crafter, I want to hear from him :).</p>  <p>Happy PostSharping!</p>  <p>-gael</p>
