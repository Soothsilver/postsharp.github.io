<p>There’s been some remarkable contributions from the community these last days; so let me write just a few words to introduce them.</p>  <h2>Attribute-Based Caching</h2>  <p>Adam Bell released an <a href="http://cache.codeplex.com/">aspect library</a> that addresses a single concern: caching. In Adam’s own words:</p>  <blockquote class="quotation">   <p>Cache expensive methods calls with a declarative attribute. No custom code required. Configure caching method using unity. Options include In-process and Out-Of-Process and Off. Out-Of-Process uses Microsoft ApplicationServer.Caching.</p> </blockquote>  <p>The project supports <em>declarative</em> cache invalidation. It is released under BSD license and hosted on <a href="http://cache.codeplex.com/">CodePlex</a>.</p>  <p>For more information about this project, read <a href="http://cascadeofinsights.com/post/1410736927/introducing-attribute-based-caching">Adam’s blog</a>.</p>  <h2>Unit Testing of Aspects</h2>  <p>Michael Collins blogged about <a href="http://www.michaelfcollins3.me/2010/10/method-tracing-using-log4net-and-postsharp/">implementing method tracing using log4net and PostSharp</a>. Déjà vu? Wait. It’s true that tracing is the “hello world” example of AOP, but Michael gives us a production-ready implementation.</p>  <p>The most remarkable point of this post, for me, is that Michael shows us how to unit-test the aspects using a mocking framework. Very cool!</p>  <p>Many thanks to Adam and Michael for their great contributions!</p>  <p>Happy PostSharping!</p>  <p>-gael</p>
