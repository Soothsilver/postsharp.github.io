<p><img style="margin: 0px 5px 0px 0px; display: inline; float: left;" src="http://gallery.mailchimp.com/c8cab4b857833ba380982d9d0/images/Karol_Waledzik2.1.jpg" alt="" width="129" height="194" align="left" />Last month Karol Waledzik, a software architect and team lead at Internetium, <a href="http://www.sharpcrafters.com/blog/post/The-Definitive-INotifyPropertyChanged.aspx">wrote a 2-part blog post</a> about <strong>the pain WPF and Silverlight developers experience by having to manually implement change notifications.</strong></p>
<p>He debuted the PostSharp Domain Toolkit and wrote about the pain it alleviates by <a href="http://www.sharpcrafters.com/blog/post/The-Definitive-INotifyPropertyChanged-Pt-2.aspx">automatically handling (nearly) all standard business cases</a> and generating exactly the right notifications, at exactly the right time.</p>
<p>Last week he demoed the toolkit during a live webinar, showing how it makes short work of change notification pain for developers and sharing details on its inner-workings.</p>
<p>Watch the recording and learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why previous attempts to tackle INotifyPropertyChanged by other libraries fell short</li>
<li>What makes the Domain Toolkit different from other libraries</li>
<li>How the toolkit automates change notifications</li>
<li>What other scenarios the toolkit supports automatically</li>
<li>The limitations of the toolkit and available customization</li>
</ul>
<p>The recording below includes the entire webinar plus Q&amp;A session where Karol answered questions from the audience about the toolkit, the scenarios it currently handles and those still planned.</p>
