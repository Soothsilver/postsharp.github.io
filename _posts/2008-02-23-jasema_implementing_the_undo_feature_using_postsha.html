An <a href="http://karlagius.wordpress.com/2008/02/01/implementing-the-undo-feature-for-jasema/">interesting post on The Simple Part</a> explains how to use PostSharp to implement an "Undo" feature in Jasema,  a tool to create WPF Path Geometry in an easy user friendly way.

<p>The trick is to apply a "journaling" aspect on some front-end methods. The aspect record the object state before and after execution.

</p><p>Congratulations to 'Karlagius' for this original use of AOP!
