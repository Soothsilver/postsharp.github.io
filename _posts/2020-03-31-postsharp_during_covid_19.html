<p>Just a quick summary of how we approach COVID-19 situation.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- readmore-->

<h2>Business Continuity</h2>
<p>As most of other companies in our industry, PostSharp team is remote now and is operating at full speed. Our recent migration to a cloud-only company made the transition even easier.</p>
<p>We have taken precautionary measures to reduce useless exposure to risks, improve the remote work experience, and keep our mental sanity.</p>
<p>At the time of writing this article, we don&rsquo;t see any reason for interruptions in business and support operations of PostSharp, and <strong>we expect everything to keep running as usual, including our technical support and customer assistance</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Community Support</h2>
<p>We believe it is a double privilege to be able to continue business as usual and not exposing ourselves to hygienic risks. We believe everybody should contribute according to their abilities, therefore we have decided to provide 20% time to our employees for community support related to COVID-19 crisis.</p>
<p>One of our teammates had already put our 3D printer in good use, working hard on printing face shields and donating them to people who need it most. Our production capacity is now 12 units per day &ndash; a small drop in the hundreds being produced daily by the community.</p>
<p>You can watch our printer in action in this 24/7 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlQRv3Ybwfk">live stream</a>. Here&rsquo;s a picture of our set up, supervised 24/7 by our mascot, the debugging duck.</p>
