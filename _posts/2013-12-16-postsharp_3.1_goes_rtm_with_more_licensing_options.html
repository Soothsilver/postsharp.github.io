<p>We&rsquo;re excited to announce that PostSharp 3.1 RTM is now available for download from <a href="http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/a058d5d3-e654-43f8-a308-c3bdfdd0be4a">Visual Studio Gallery</a> and <a href="http://www.nuget.org/packages/PostSharp">NuGet</a>.</p>



<p>Before we even mention the new features, we have good news for those who are just interested in a specific functionality in PostSharp such as logging or INotifyPropertyChanged:</p>
<h2>PostSharp Pattern Libraries Available as Stand-Alone Purchases</h2>
<p>It is now possible to <strong>purchase PostSharp Pattern Libraries separately</strong> so you don&rsquo;t have to buy PostSharp Ultimate if you only need a small part of it. Please <a href="http://www.postsharp.net/purchase">check the prices online</a> and let us know if you have any questions.</p>
<h2>What&rsquo;s New in PostSharp 3.1</h2>
<p>PostSharp 3.1 builds on the vision of PostSharp 3.0, but makes it more convenient to use. It also catches up with the C# compiler features, and adds more flexible licensing options. You can read more about the new features in the <a href="http://www.postsharp.net/blog/post/Announcing-PostSharp-31-Preview">PostSharp 3.1 Preview Announcement</a>. In short, PostSharp 3.1 brings you:</p>
<ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
<li><strong>faster builds</strong>: PostSharp can now optionally install itself in GAC and generate native images. This decreases build time of a fraction of a second for each project: a substantial gain if you have a lot of projects.</li>
<li><strong>support for async and iterator methods</strong>: when you applied an OnMethodBoundaryAspect to a method that was compiled into a state machine, whether an iterator or an async method, the code generated by PostSharp would not be very useful:&nbsp; the aspect would just be applied to the method that implements the state machine. An OnException advise had no chance to get ever fired. Starting from PostSharp 3.1, OnMethodBoundaryAspect understands that is being applied to a state machine, and works as you would expect.</li>
<li><strong>solution-level policies and improved configuration system</strong>: PostSharp 3.1 makes it easier to share configuration across several projects. For instance, you can now add aspects to all projects of a solution in just a few clicks.</li>
<li><strong>locations (file/line) of errors and warnings</strong>: when previous versions of PostSharp had to report an error or a warning, it would include the name of the type and/or method causing the message, but was unable to determine the file and line number. You can now double-click on an error message in Visual Studio and you&rsquo;ll get to the relevant location for the error message.</li>
<li><strong>automatic indentation in logging</strong>: for better log readability, PostSharp Diagnostics Pattern Library now automatically indents log entries when entering and exiting methods.</li>
</ul>
<p>All customers with an active maintenance subscription can upgrade to PostSharp 3.1 for free.</p>
<p>Happy PostSharping!</p>
