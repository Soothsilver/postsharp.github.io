<h2>Good News First</h2><p>I am happy to announce PostSharp 2.0 RC 2, available for <a href="http://www.sharpcrafters.com/downloads/postsharp-2.0/rc-2">download</a> now. From this release, the low-level library <strong>PostSharp.Sdk.dll</strong> has now a class reference documentation and all APIes are frozen. </p>

  <p>Apart from lack of SDK documentation, the feedback from RC 1 is excellent. The number of reported bugs was historically small.</p>  <h2>And Now Bad News</h2>  <p>I will probably annoy a lot of people with this release but I had to do it.&#160; I originally wanted to document PostSharp.Sdk after the RTW of version 2.0. Documenting is typically the moment I discover inconsistencies and correct them, breaking backward-compatibility. So by postponing SDK documentation to the next release, I also would also have postponed the promise of forward possibility, and forced many users to stay with PostSharp 1.5. So I decided to do this API clean-up and class reference documentation now</p>  <p>When documenting, I figured out there was some mess in the namespace organization, since some low-level APIes shared the same namespace of high-level APIes. So I did some clean up there. This affects also <strong>PostSharp.dll</strong>.</p>  <p>Concretely, you’ll probably have to do a global find-and-replace of import statements. I believe it’s a matter of 10 minutes to do the changes. I apologize for inconvenience. I think it’s better for everyone to do this small change now than to drag a debt during several years.</p>  <h2></h2>  <h2>Breaking Changes for Everybody</h2>  <p>The namespace <strong>PostSharp.CodeModel</strong> and <strong>PostSharp.CodeModel.ReflectionWrapper</strong> has been merged into <strong>PostSharp.Reflection</strong>. This has pretty low impact; the following find-and-replace will do the trick:</p>  <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" width="400"><tbody>     <tr>       <td valign="top" width="200"><strong>Find what</strong></td>        <td valign="top" width="198"><strong>Replace with</strong></td>     </tr>      <tr>       <td valign="top" width="200">using PostSharp.CodeModel;</td>        <td valign="top" width="198">using PostSharp.Reflection;</td>     </tr>   </tbody></table>  <h2>Breaking Changes in the Low-Level API</h2>  <p>Basically, all low-level namespaces have been moved under the namespace <strong>PostSharp.Sdk</strong>. For instance, instead of <strong>PostSharp.CodeModel</strong> you will have <strong>PostSharp.Sdk.CodeModel</strong>.The same for most namespaces contained in PostSharp.Sdk.dll (the exception is PostSharp.Hosting, which is not considered a part of the SDK).</p>  <h2>Other changes</h2>  <ol>   <li>Added an aspect (ManagedResourceIntroductionAspect) that allows to introduce a managed resource</li>    <li>Solved a race in the pipe client.</li>    <li>Solved an issue where IAssemblyLevelAspect.CompileTimeInitialize is not invoked.</li>    <li>Solved issues with the “Update Avaibable” warning.</li> </ol>  <p>Happy PostSharping – and thank you for your understanding.</p>  <p>-gael</p>
