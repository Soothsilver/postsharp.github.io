PostSharp4Unity modifies assemblies after compilation to make objects
self-configurable: you don't need to call a factory method; you can use the
default constructor. All you have to do is to decorate your class with the
custom attribute "Configurable". It smells like Spring, isn't it ;-).



It is available from
<a class="externalLink" href="http://code.google.com/p/postsharp-user-plugins/">
http://code.google.com/p/postsharp-user-plugins/<span class="externalLinkIcon"></span></a>.



I have updated the StopLight sample. The first change is on the
StoplightForm class:

<pre>[Configurable]
public partial class StoplightForm : Form, IStoplightView
  {
</pre>
Then, in Program.Main, you can use the default constructor:

<pre>Application.Run(new StoplightForm());
</pre>
Unfortunately, that's not all. Since Unity has no notion of context registry
(i.e. no notion of "current container"), you have to build a basic one:



<pre>
public sealed class UnityContainerProvider : IUnityContainerProvider
{
   private readonly IUnityContainer container;
  
    public UnityContainerProvider()
    {
       this.container = new UnityContainer()
         .Register&lt;ILogger, TraceLogger&gt;()
         .Register&lt;IStoplightTimer, RealTimeTimer&gt;();
    }

    public IUnityContainer  CurrentContainer
     { get { return this.container; } }
}  </pre>


Then tell
PostSharp4Unity to build your container: <pre>[assembly: DefaultUnityContainerProvider(
  typeof(UnityContainerProvider))]
</pre>
As you can see, there is a little of set up to do, but it's only once per
assembly. (And would be useless if there were some Unity-wide notion of
context registry or default container.) At this price, you can use Unity
with any object without having to construct them using a factory method.




Pay attention that your
'configurable' objects are now configured <b>before</b> the constructor is
executed, and not <b>after</b>. So, in the class StoplightForm, we have to
move the view initialization at the end of the constructor:
<pre>[Configurable]
public partial class StoplightForm : Form, IStoplightView
{
   private StoplightPresenter presenter;

   public StoplightForm()
   {
      InitializeComponent();
      presenter.SetView(this);
    }

   [Dependency]
    public StoplightPresenter Presenter
    {
      get { return presenter; }
      set { presenter = value; }
    }
</pre>
There are still some problems being discussed, but at least you have the
first bits.



Happy PostSharping!
