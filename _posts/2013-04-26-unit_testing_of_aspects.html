<p>If thereâ€™s one topic that is subject to almost religious observance, this is unit testing. </p> <p>There has been much hesitation in the community about how PostSharp aspects should be tested and how aspects can consume dependencies from a dependency injection container. </p> <p>Obviously, we have a lot of experience testing aspects. I finally took the time to write down a set of practices that can be used to <a href="http://doc.postsharp.net/postsharp-3.0/Content.aspx/PostSharp-3.0.chm/html/2ad6cf92-08eb-4537-a434-d88a3e493721.htm" target="_blank">create efficient tests of aspects</a>. I also show techniques that allow aspects to <a href="http://doc.postsharp.net/postsharp-3.0/Content.aspx/PostSharp-3.0.chm/html/b57d32e9-f760-4fd2-9a2c-af41a1f00430.htm" target="_blank">consume services</a> from a dependency injection container. Last but not least, I publish and document a <a href="http://doc.postsharp.net/postsharp-3.0/Content.aspx/PostSharp-3.0.chm/html/0264eebb-4e36-494c-bc8c-248c9d2c305c.htm" target="_blank">test framework for aspect build-time logic</a>, especially logic emitting build-time errors and warnings. The framework is derived from the one we are using internally.</p> <p>More on our <a href="http://doc.postsharp.net/postsharp-3.0/Content.aspx/PostSharp-3.0.chm/html/2ad6cf92-08eb-4537-a434-d88a3e493721.htm" target="_blank">online documentation</a>.</p> <p>Happy PostSharping!</p> <p>-gael</p>
