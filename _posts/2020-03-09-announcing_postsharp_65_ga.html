<p>With this release we made a significant improvements to build-time and design-time performance of PostSharp.</p>
<p>What is worth mentioning is that PostSharp 6.5 is&nbsp;<strong>LTS</strong> (<strong>Long Term Support</strong>) release, meaning that this release is supported for 5 years after the general availability date or one year after we publish the next LTS (the same policy as .NET Core LTS). Also PostSharp 6.5 marks an important milestone for us, as we can finally proudly say that .NET Core is now measured up to .NET Framework.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is the summary of all great improvements and features in PostSharp 6.5:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Support for Docker</strong> - we have successfully tested our product with all Docker images of .NET provided by Microsoft.</li>
<li><strong>Build-Time performance enhancements: up to 2x faster</strong> - the startup time of PostSharp on .NET Core has decreased significantly and is now on par with the one on .NET Framework.</li>
<li><strong>PostSharp Tools for Visual Studio performance improvements</strong>&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Support for IMemoryCache and the new Azure Service Bus API in Caching</strong> - we added suport for the modern Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Memory.IMemoryCache interface on .NET Core and Microsoft.Azure.ServiceBus, the new API for Azure Service Bus.</li>
</ul>
