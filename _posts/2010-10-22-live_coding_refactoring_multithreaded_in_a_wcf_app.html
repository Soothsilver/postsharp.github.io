<p>Just a quick note to mention I have just published the recording of my session at the European Software Conference on October 7th 2010: <a href="http://www.sharpcrafters.com/media/sc2010-preview">Refactoring multithreading in a WPF application using aspects</a>. It’s real live coding – always a hard exercise, especially after a night with 2 just hours of sleep (the reason being <a href="http://www.sharpcrafters.com/blog/post/Why-Care-About-Software-Craftsmanship-1.aspx">hopefully clear</a>).</p>  <p>In this session, I start from a half-finished WPF application and add three concerns: exception handling, background thread, and updating the status bar. I compare the plain old C# implementation to the AOP/PostSharp implementation.</p>  <p>Enjoy! Comments are welcome on this post.</p>  <p>Happy PostSharping!</p>  <p>-gael</p>
