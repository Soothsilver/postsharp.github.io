<p>PostSharp 6.4 is out and there are many features and improvements that we are excited about. You can <a href="https://www.postsharp.net/downloads/postsharp-6.4">download</a> it from our website or from the <a href="https://www.nuget.org/profiles/PostSharp">NuGet gallery</a>.</p>



<p>Staying true to our promises to enhance a developer&rsquo;s experience by eradicating boilerplate and allowing for more clarity, PostSharp now fully supports <strong>.NET Core 3.0 - 3.1</strong>, .<strong>NET Standard 2.1</strong>,<strong> C# 8.0</strong> and more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What does that mean exactly?&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>If you have a .NET Framework application that uses PostSharp, you can now start migrating to .NET Core.</li>
<li>PostSharp has been tested and fixed for all new features of C# 8.0.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>So, if there was a time to get excited, it is now :)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is the summary of all great features in PostSharp 6.4:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Support for .NET Core 3.0-3.1 and .NET Standard 2.1</strong> &ndash; yes, we've said it already. We've also updated our package PostSharp.Patterns.Xaml to make sure it works with WPF on .NET Core.</li>
<li><strong>Support for C# 8.0</strong> &ndash; default interface methods, nullable reference types and read-only struct members &ndash; all fixed and tested in PostSharp 6.4. Go on and try it :)&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Support for field/property initializers (breaking change!)</strong> &ndash; initialization of static fields and properties is now intercepted by the LocationInterceptionAspect.</li>
<li><strong>Free ordering of MethodBoundaryAspect and MethodInterceptionAspect on iterators</strong> - it is now possible to freely order an OnMethodBoundaryAspect before or after a MethodInterceptionAspect on iterator methods.</li>
</ul>
<p>For detailed description, go back and read the<a href="https://www.postsharp.net/blog/post/announcing-postsharp-64-rc"> RC announcement</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>

We have proven that we do keep up the pace with the new generation of .NET technologies and we are planning on continuing that way.&nbsp;</p>
