<p>We&rsquo;ve highlighted some notable features in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.postsharp.net/blog/post/Announcing-PostSharp-63-RC-Support-for-Linux-Improved-VSX-Performance-and-More">6.3 RC announcement</a>&nbsp;such as the support for Linux and macOS build agents as well as significant improvement of the responsiveness of PostSharp Tools for Visual Studio thanks to a full async redesign.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, here is the summary of what&rsquo;s new and great in this release:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&bull;&nbsp;<strong>Support for Linux and macOS build agents&nbsp;</strong>&ndash; note that development is still only officially supported on Visual Studio for Windows</p>
<p>&bull;&nbsp;<strong>Improved responsiveness of PostSharp Tools for Visual Studio</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; making PostSharp a well-behaved asynchronous extension</p>
<p>&bull;&nbsp;<strong>Support for shared and multi-targeted projects</strong>&nbsp;- PostSharp Tools for Visual Studio now works properly with files that are shared between several projects, and with multi-targeted projects</p>
<p>&bull;&nbsp;<strong>Support for per-monitor awareness of DPI</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; resulting in much smoother experience</p>
<p>&bull;&nbsp;<strong>Solved aspect ordering issue on async methods</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; for instance, it is now possible to add a code contract to the return value of a cached async method</p>
<p>&bull;&nbsp;<strong>Contracts: ability to customize the type of thrown exceptions</strong>&nbsp;- we now use a factory pattern to instantiate exceptions, so you can completely customize the exceptions thrown by standard contracts</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
